# lodgify_case

To run this program it' necessary to install configparser, pandas, and ipython libraries to make sure that all transformations
will be executed correctly.

But, before it I suggest you to create a virtual environment, as a best practice, and run the code inside that.

### Creating Virtual Environment
 - Create venv: 
    ```
    python3 -m venv {name_venv}
    ```
 - Activate venv: 
    ```
    source {name_venv}/bin/activate
    ```

 - Deactivate vm:
    ```
    deactivate
    ```


### Installing libraries
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Then run the main.py file in the root directory:
```
python3 main.py
```


As the result expected for this program, like it's in the "Python Challenge.pdf" file, is to create python a script to generate files that would answer four questions, these answer are loaded inside the directory sandbox/files as CSV files (as requested).
